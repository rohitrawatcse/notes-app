My Learnings from this 

Your primary focus JavaScript wise should be on the following:

window.createRange()
window.createRange().surroundContents()
Node.cloneNode()
window.getSelection()
window.getSelection().getRangeAt(0).commonAncestorContainer
appendChild
insertBefore
insertBefore + nextSibling
replaceChild


Corporate rules for a happy life:

1. Trust nobody.

2. What happens in office, remains in office. Never take office gossips to home and vice versa.

3. Enter office on time, leave on time. Your desktop is not helping improvement in your health.

4. Never make GF/BF and/or brother/sister in office. It will always backfire.

5. Expect nothing. If somebody helps, feel thankful. If not, you will learn to know things on your own.

6. Never rush for position. If you get promoted, congrats. If not, it doesn't matter. You will always be remembered for your knowledge and politeness, not for your designation.

7. Never run behind office stuff. You have better things to do in life.

8. Avoid taking everything on your ego. Your salary matters. You are being paid. Use your assets to get happiness.

9. It doesn't matter how people treat you. Be humble. You are not everyone's cup of tea.

10. In the end nothing matters except family, friends, home, and Inner peace.
